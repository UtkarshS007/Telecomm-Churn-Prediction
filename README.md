# Telecomm-Churn-Prediction

This project was assigned as a part of a company assessment. The compnay was based out of Texas (shall remain unnamed for Privacy reasons)

## Problem Statement 
**Background**

TelConnect, a leading telecommunications provider, has been experiencing increasing customer churn rates over the past year. Retention costs have risen by 45% as the team responds to more cancellation calls, prompting concern from the executive team about the sustainability of current retention practices.

The company maintains a database with detailed customer information that is refreshed monthly, including:

- Demographics
- Service subscriptions
-	Account information
-	Tenure of the account
-	Customer status (whether they left TelConnect in the following month)

**Your Task**

TelConnect has a wealth of customer data, but how can it be used to predict churn and address it proactively? What patterns or signals in the data might reveal which customers are at risk of leaving?
